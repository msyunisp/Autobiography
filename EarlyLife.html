            I was born in Iligan City, Mindanao, but after my father passed away in 2020-2021, my family moved to Cebu City, where I continued my journey. Growing up, I was a curious and adventurous child, always eager to explore the world around me. I loved playing outside, discovering new places, and trying different hobbies. Some of my best memories were spent with my cousins and friends, playing and having fun together since we were little.

            As a kid, I was naturally drawn to technology, games, and anything creative. I enjoyed learning, though there were subjects I excelled in and others I found challenging. Despite the ups and downs, my early experiences taught me the importance of hard work and perseverance, shaping me into the person I am today.
