    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="about-box">
        <p>Hey! I’m Eunice Pialan, originally from Iligan City, Mindanao, but now living in Cebu City. I’m 21 years old and single, and I have a passion for exploring new places, trying different foods, and experiencing new things.
            I am currently studying at Cebu Technological University - Main Campus, pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS). I have been a part-time student since senior high school, balancing my studies while continuously learning and growing.
